            "History": "Founded in 1890, the Dominican University of California is an independent university, distinguished by its history, geographic location, student profile, and educational philosophy. Our mission is to educate and prepare students to be ethical leaders and socially responsible global citizens who incorporate the Dominican values of study, reflection, community, and service into their lives. Located in Marin County, only 12 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge, Dominican offers more than 60 undergraduate and graduate programs of study with an educational approach designed to serve our diverse student body. \n\nWe provide students with a rigorous core curriculum while offering strong professional programs in the health sciences, business, and education. Our nationally recognized signature program, the Dominican Experience, allows undergraduate students to work with a coach, complete signature work, build a digital portfolio, and engage with the community. In 2020, Dominican was named the nation\u2019s most transformative four-year university by the American Council on Education (ACE) in recognition of a deep commitment to student opportunity and success. \n\nDominican sponsors 11 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II sports and is a member of the PacWest Conference, the largest conference in the NCAA Division II West Region. Engaged Learning \u2014 a hallmark of a Dominican education \u2014 incorporates active, collaborative learning in the classroom with enriching educational experiences beyond the classroom. Students apply academic skills and critical thinking to address societal issues, working in partnership with more than 30 community organizations. The Dominican/LINES Ballet BFA in Dance program, offered in partnership with Alonzo King LINES Ballet School, combines Dominican's comprehensive liberal arts education with technically rigorous and artistically expansive dance training. Dominican offers a research-intensive curriculum for undergraduate science education. \n\nProfessors train students to work independently on specific research topics early in their freshman year, providing a unique experience and contributing to the success of faculty research programs. Each year, students from all disciplines present their original research at regional and national academic conferences. Students conduct research in many areas, including malaria, cancer, coral reefs, ecosystem health, marine wildlife, ecology, sudden oak death (SOD), sensory integration, autism, healthy aging, emergency room use during the Covid pandemic, access to healthcare in low-income communities, among other topics. Student research is shared worldwide via Dominican Scholar, the university's online research repository.",
