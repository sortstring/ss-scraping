In 1770-1780, the University was transferred to Buda and later to Pest, and with the support of Maria Theresa, the Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, became the Royal Hungarian University.Over the following decades, new faculties were established to meet the expectations of a learned society. In the second half of the 19th century, the University developed into a centre of modern higher education in today's sense. In 1950, the university was reorganized and adopted its present name. It was named after one of its professors, the world-famous physicist, Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s. Over the last hundred years, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University (ELTE) has had many world famous scientists and four Nobel Prize laureates among its teachers and alumni",
