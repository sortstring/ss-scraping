Quest Education Corporation was purchased in July 2000 by Kaplan, Inc. In November 2000, the name of the College was changed to Kaplan College, which soon began to offer degrees online with just 34 students and a handful of degree options. In 2004, Kaplan College expanded its academic offerings to include master\u2019s-level programs and became Kaplan University. In 2017, it was announced that Purdue University would acquire Kaplan University, and in early 2018 this transition was completed, forming a new institution called Purdue University Global",
