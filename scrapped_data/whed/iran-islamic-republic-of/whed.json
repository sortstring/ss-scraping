After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the school merged with the University of Mazandaran (UMZ) to become a College of Engineering and changed its curriculum to offer undergraduate and graduate degree programs in engineering. In 2005, following public demand and supported by donations from people of Babol, the institution started a process of independence from UMZ, during which it was temporarily referred to as \u201cNoshirvani Technical and Education Complex\u201d. Since March 2008, BNUT has been an independent public university under the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology",

            "History": "Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources (GUASNR), is the first higher education institute in Iran specializing in agricultural sciences and natural resources. GUASNR was inaugurated by Agricultural Minister as the Junior College of Forestry and Range Management in 1957. Through a course of continued development, the Junior College was promoted to the school of Natural Resources offering three major courses in Forestry, Range Management and Soil Conservation in 1975. After Islamic revolution, the School of Natural Resources was joined to the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology in 1981 and became part of the Mazandaran University. In 1986, the school was united with Junior College of Agriculture in the town of Gonbad and obtained an approval from the Council of Academic Development of the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, to upgrade to an independent institute called Gorgan University Complex of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. As a result of the hard work of the academic members and administrative staff, Council of Academic Development passed an approval based on which the complex was promoted to the Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources (GUASNR) on June 25th, 1992. \nGUASNR is trying to achieve the set goals and qualities through providing a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs in many fields leading to B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D degrees. Today the GUASNR consists of 178 full-time academic members and a number of part-time and adjunct professors and affiliated members. The University has about 3824 students among them 38% are graduate students. \nThe University has 9 faculties with a total of 26 departments at 2 different campuses. GUASNR, as the first and main teaching and research university in agricultural sciences and natural resources in Iran, offers 23 undergraduate and 80 postgraduate programs. In addition, GUASNR publishes 11 national and 3 international scientific journals.",
