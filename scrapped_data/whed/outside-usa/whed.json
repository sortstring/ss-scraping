Geneva Business School provides Swiss-quality business education in Geneva, Barcelona, and Madrid, offering bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, MBA, and diverse continued education options that are 100% in English, and is committed to using innovative learning methods and new technologies to fully prepare students for the tools and environment of the professional marketplace. \nIn the beginning, the focus was on providing training and professional development for bankers in Switzerland.\nIn the early 2000s, the school developed new iterations of its offering and public persona, up until 2009 when the name Geneva Business School was made official. A focus on quality quickly led to a number of international accreditations to offer recognized degrees to its students. Over the course of the next decade, the structure of the school evolved to include undergraduate students, rising to meet the demands of a global business environment.\nToday Geneva Business School hosts a diverse student community and faculty with over 80 nationalities across our campuses, and a proud alumni network growing with each graduation.",

In the year 2000 the school changed to its current name, Swiss School of Management. In order to facilitate international students to freely move in search for jobs to other European countries, the school decided to move its campus to Rome, Italy. Meanwhile, SSM has reopened its headquarter in the beautiful city of Bellinzona back in Switzerland. The high demand of students coming from other countries, who couldn't afford the very expensive living costs and tuition fees in Switzerland, motivated the school to open new learning centers in Dubai, Bahrian, Brescia and Cairo. Tuday the school counts over 5,000 students from all over the world.",
