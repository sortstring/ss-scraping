It comprises a federation of central member institutions and research institutes that include world leaders in their fields: Birkbeck, University of London; City, University of London; Courtauld Institute of Art; Goldsmiths, University of London; Institute of Cancer Research; King's College London, London Business School, London School of Economics and Political Science; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Queen Mary University of London; Royal Academy of Music; Royal Central School of Speech and Drama; Royal Holloway, University of London; Royal Veterinary College; School of Advanced Study; School of Oriental and African Studies; St George's, University of London; UCL; and University of London Institute in Paris",

In July 2010 the University completed the divestment of its site in King's Road, Reading, and in April 2011 formally changed its name to The University of West London",
